* allow 2 radii, one for TSS and one for TES, and handle gene strand (include BEDtools? or htslib?)
* add option to allow to skip some configs in eqtlbma_bf
* speed-up tutorial (with Rcpp?) to simulate more subgroups quicker
* add penalty to pi0 in EM
* add option to eqtlbma_bf to choose if "meta-analysis" BFs should be saved
* allow eqtlbma_bf to read summary stats with cov of beta-hats
* use tabix library when parsing genotype files in VCF and IMPUTE formats
* make a real R package, at first only with all current R scripts
* check init parameters from file in eqtlbma_hm (e.g. sum to 1)
* think about using HDF5 files to efficiently store and retrieve results
* handle categorical covariates with more than 2 levels in eqtlbma_bf
* add unitary tests in C++ (include cppunit? or tpunitpp?)

* allow --gridM to exceed --gridL
